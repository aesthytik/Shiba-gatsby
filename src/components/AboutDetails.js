          Hello. I m ShiBa from maldives. I m just a young girl who is interested in drawing. I used to draw Mandala, Zentangle and Doodle normally. Before i used to sketch but after getting interested into this newly world of Doodle i cant keep my eye out of it. Despite that, i love to read books, listening to music.
          To see my artworks you can check out my instagram.
          Thankyou so much for the visit. I hope i didnt regret your this precious time
